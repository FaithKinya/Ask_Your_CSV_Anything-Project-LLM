## About

This project is a CSV analytics assistant built with **Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit**.  
It uses **Llama 3** (local/open-source LLM) for natural language question answering on the dataset, allowing users to ask questions like:

- "Which category is most profitable?"  
- "Sales per region"  
- "Top-selling products"

The dashboard also provides **interactive visualizations** and **KPI metrics**.
